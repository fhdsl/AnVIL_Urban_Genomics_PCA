# Activity Overview

This activity is based on Carlen and Munshi-South’s 2020 paper “Widespread genetic connectivity of feral pigeons across the Northeastern megacity”. The idea and data are used with the permission of Dr. Elizabeth Carlen.

Students will learn how to do a principal component analysis (or PCA) using real genetic data from feral pigeons.
