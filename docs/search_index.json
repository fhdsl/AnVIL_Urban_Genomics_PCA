You will: * Set up a billing project for tracking costs * Add yourself and students to the billing project to grant permission to AnVIL resources * Learn about different sources of costs in AnVIL * Estimate costs for your class * Learn about how to track costs during your class 4.1 Creating a billing project First, create the Billing Project. Billing Project names must be globally unique and cannot exceed 30 characters. We suggest the name of the Billing Project should be a combination of institution-class- (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-bill-1”). To create a Billing Project: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “+CREATE” Type in your Billing Project name Select the appropriate Billing Account Click “CREATE BILLING PROJECT” You now have a unique Billing Project. 4.2 Adding Instructors as “Owner” Next, you want to give instructors permission to use the Billing Project to compute. To set instructor permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made in Instructor Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the instructor Group name set up in Instructor Group. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors@firecloud.org). Ensure “Can manage users (Owner)” is selected Click “ADD USER” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit permissions and administer the Billing Project as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the student Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should always use the instructor Workspace to compute. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with instructors versus students. 4.3 Adding Students as “User” Next, you will add your student Group to the Billing Project so that they can compute. To set student permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made in Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the student Group name set up in Student Group. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-students@firecloud.org). Keep “Can manage users (Owner)” deselected. Click “ADD USER” 4.4 Understanding the various billing costs Costs in AnVIL fall into one of three categories: compute costs, storage costs, and network usage (egress) costs. Compute costs are those that students accrue when actively using an AnVIL Workspace. Students can clone a Workspace for no cost, but they will begin to accrue costs as soon as they set up a cloud environment. Compute costs are based on how many CPUs you need, as well as how much memory and storage space you choose. You can also pause the Workspace and pay a lower cost per hour than if you were to keep the Workspace running. Current prices can be found here. Storage costs are driven by the persistent disk. The persistent disk allows you to store data and installed programs/libraries for a low cost. Students can delete their Workspaces but maintain their persistent disk so they still have access to previous programs they have installed and previous files they’ve created. Current prices can be found here. Finally, network usage costs are those involved with transferring data between networks or downloading data from the cloud to your local computer. Current prices can be found here. 4.5 Estimating costs before the class begins AnVIL has a free AnVIL_Cost_Estimator that allows you estimate compute, storage, and network usage costs for your class. This is a Google sheet that you can tailor to fit your needs. Before you use it, make sure the prices are up to date by following the links at the bottom of the sheet. If you need to create a Budget Justification for your class, you can also use the free AnVIL_Budget_Justification template. 4.6 How much does a class cost? One of the advantages of billing projects in Terra is that you can keep track of the costs during real time. You can see how much each Workspace is costing while your course is happening, so there are no unexpected surprises at the end! Full details about billing in Terra can be found here. These instructions are adapted from Terra Support. To view the costs being accrued by each billing project, you can go to https://console.cloud.google.com/billing. At the top of the page, there is a dropdown menu. Choose the billing project name you’d like to view. Once you are in proper billing project, you click on “View detailed charges” in the Billing section on the far right. This takes you to a report of the detailed charges accrued by the billing account. Here, you will be able to see the total cost over a time range, as well as costs broken down by services.

You will need to have a list of who will be taking your class, such as a course roster or sign-up list, as well as a list of additional instructors or teaching assistants. You can make changes later, so the list of students need not be final. 5.2 Collect Google IDs AnVIL IDs are based on Google accounts. Students – Contact students/participants to get their AnVIL IDs. These should be Gmail addresses or emails with GSuite capabilities. You can link students to Student Account Setup for instructions on what they should do. Co-instructors – If you will be working with other instructors, such as co-instructors or teaching assistants, you will need to collect their IDs as well. 5.3 Set Up Groups Reminder: Google Billing Accounts are managed on Google Cloud Platform and are used for organizing funding sources (e.g. credit cards, cloud credits). Terra Billing Projects are managed through Terra, and allow you to associate your Terra activity with the correct Google Billing Account. For a more detailed explanation, please see the chapter on Account Setup. We suggest creating two different Terra Billing Projects under the appropriate Billing Account that you created on cloud.google.com: one for students and one for co-instructors. The instructions below will walk you through how to set this up. Groups enable you to share your class Workspace and manage permissions for many people at once. We recommend starting with one Group for instructors and one Group for students. Instructor Group {#instructor-group} Create an informative, unique Group name for any co-instructors and teaching assistants. We suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-instructors”). Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes are allowed in Group names. To create a Group for instructors: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups Click “+ Create a New Group” Type in your instructor Group name Click “CREATE GROUP” You now have a unique instructor Group. Add Instructors as “Admin” (Instructor Group) Now that your instructor Group has been created, you should add any additional instructors. You should also ensure that they have the correct permissions. Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the instructor Group name. This page should also be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add the instructor’s AnVIL ID. Type in the instructor’s AnVIL ID Make sure “Can manage users (admin)” is selected Click ADD USER. This will take you back to the Group administration page. Make sure the newly added instructor displays “Admin” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. Repeat this process for any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants. Student Group {#student-group} Next, you will create a Group for your students. Create an informative, unique Group name. We suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-students”). Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes are allowed in Group names. To create a Group for students: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups Click “+ Create a New Group” Type in your student Group name Click “CREATE GROUP” You now have a unique student Group. Add Instructors as “Admin” (Student Group) The next steps ensure any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants are able to administer the student Group in case you are unavailable. Follow the steps below to add each co-instructor in the student Group: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the student Group name. This page should be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add the instructor’s AnVIL ID. Type in the instructor’s AnVIL ID Make sure “Can manage users (admin)” is selected Click ADD USER. This will take you back to the Group administration page. Make sure the newly added instructor displays “Admin” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. Repeat this process for any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants. Add Students as “Member” Follow the steps below to add individual students to the student Group: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the student Group name. This page should be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add an AnVIL ID. Type in the student’s AnVIL ID Click ADD USER Make sure the newly added student displays “Member” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. At present, each student’s AnVIL ID must be added separately. Your instructor and student Groups are now set up. Group Email Lists Note that your newly created Groups have Group emails associated with them. Take note of these Group emails. You will use them for granting access to your class Billing Projects and Workspaces in the next steps. 5.4 Set Up Billing Projects Billing Projects in Terra help organize your compute costs. Like Groups, we suggest creating two different billing projects under the appropriate Billing Account that you created on cloud.google.com: one for students and one for co-instructors. Billing Project names must be globally unique and cannot exceed 30 characters. Instructor Billing Project {#instructor-billing-project} First, create the Billing Project for instructors. We suggest the name of the Billing Project should be a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-instructors-bill-1”). To create a Billing Project for instructors: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “+CREATE” Type in your instructor Billing Project name Select the appropriate Billing Account Click “CREATE BILLING PROJECT” You now have a unique instructor Billing Project. Add Instructors as “Owner” (Instructor Project) Next, you want to give instructors permission to use the Billing Project to compute. To set instructor permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made for instructors in Instructor Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the instructor Group name set up in Instructor Group. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors@firecloud.org). Ensure “Can manage users (Owner)” is selected Click “ADD USER” Your instructor Billing Project is now set up. Student Billing Project {#student-billing-project} Next, create a student Billing Project. Again, we suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-students-bill-1”). To create a Billing Project for students: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “+CREATE” Type in your student Billing Project name Select the appropriate Billing Account (same as above) Click “CREATE BILLING PROJECT” You now have a unique student Billing Project. Add Instructors as “Owner” (Student Project) You want to ensure any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants are able to administer the student Billing Project in case you are unavailable. To set instructor permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made for students in Student Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the instructor Group name set up in [### Set Up Groups]. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors@firecloud.org). Ensure “Can manage users (Owner)” is selected Click “ADD USER” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit permissions and administer the student Billing Project as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the student Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should always use the instructor Billing Project to compute. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with instructors versus students. Add Students as “User” Next, you will add your student Group to the student Billing Project so that they can compute. To set student permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made for students in Student Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the student Group name set up in Student Group. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-students@firecloud.org). Keep “Can manage users (Owner)” deselected. Click “ADD USER” Your student Billing Project is now set up. 5.5 Set Permissions on the Workspace Finally, you will want to set up permissions for co-instructors and students to see the class Workspace you created with the development Billing Project in Developing Content. AnVIL users can take on the “Owner”, “Writer”, or “Reader” role for a Workspace. Add Instructors as “Owner” You should add your co-instructors and teaching assistants as “Owners” to the class Workspace. This is useful if they need to edit the course content or share the space with students on your behalf. To share and change permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces and find your class Workspace you set up in Developing Content Click the teardrop button for your class Workspace Click “Share”. This will open a dialog box. Enter the name of the instructor Group (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors). This will create a dropdown for the Group permissions in the box. Select this Group. Change permissions to “Owner” using the dropdown menu under the instructor Group Click “SAVE” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit the original content of the Workspace as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the development Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should instead clone the Workspace using the instructor Billing Project. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with this iteration of your class versus further iterations (e.g., the following semester or year). Add Students as “Reader” Next, add your students as “Readers” to the class Workspace. This means they will be able to view and clone the Workspace, but not make edits or perform computations. To share the Workspace: Click the teardrop button for your class Workspace Click “Share”. This will open a dialog box. Enter the name of the student Group. This will create a dropdown for the Group permissions in the box. Select this Group. Ensure permissions are set to “Reader” (default) Click “SAVE” You have now correctly set up your class permissions! 5.6 Notify Terra Contacting Terra ahead of your class time helps the Terra team avoid any major disruptions to your class. Contact Terra by submitting a request for a hold on scheduled maintenance and downtime. It’s also a good idea to ask about major changes planned for the time prior to your class.

If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. 12.2 Cloning the workspace You will also need to clone the AnVIL workspace for this activity. 12.3 Using RStudio This activity uses the RStudio environment on AnVIL. 12.3.1 Video overview on using RStudio Here is a video tutorial that describes the basics of using RStudio on AnVIL. 12.3.2 Objectives Start compute for your RStudio environment Tour RStudio on AnVIL Stop compute to minimize expenses 12.3.3 Slides The slides for this tutorial are are located here. 12.3.4 Launching RStudio AnVIL is very versatile and can scale up to use very powerful cloud computers. It’s very important that you select a cloud computing environment appropriate to your needs to avoid runaway costs. If you are uncertain, start with the default settings; it is fairly easy to increase your compute resources later, if needed, but harder to scale down. Note that, in order to use RStudio, you must have access to a Terra Workspace with permission to compute (i.e. you must be a “Writer” or “Owner” of the Workspace). Open Terra - use a web browser to go to anvil.terra.bio In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the name of your Workspace. You should be routed to a link that looks like: https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/&lt;billing-project&gt;/&lt;workspace-name&gt;. Click on the cloud icon on the far right to access your Cloud Environment options. If you don’t see this icon, you may need to scroll to the right. In the dialogue box, click the “Settings” button under RStudio. You will see some configuration options for the RStudio cloud environment, and a list of costs because it costs a small amount of money to use cloud computing. Configure any settings you need for your cloud environment. If you are uncertain about what you need, the default configuration is a reasonable, cost-conservative choice. It is fairly easy to increase your compute resources later, if needed, but harder to scale down. Scroll down and click the “CREATE” button when you are satisfied with your setup. The dialogue box will close and you will be returned to your Workspace. You can see the status of your cloud environment by hovering over the RStudio icon. It will take a few minutes for Terra to request computers and install software. When your environment is ready, its status will change to “Running”. Click on the RStudio logo to open a new dialogue box that will let you launch RStudio. Click the launch icon to open RStudio. This is also where you can pause, modify, or delete your environment when needed. You should now see the RStudio interface with information about the version printed to the console. 12.3.5 Touring RStudio Next, we will be using RStudio and the package Glimma to create interactive plots. See this vignette for more information. The Bioconductor team has created a very useful package to programmatically interact with Terra and Google Cloud. Install the AnVIL package. It will make some steps easier as we go along. You can now quickly install precompiled binaries using the AnVIL package’s install() function. We will use it to install the Glimma package and the airway package. The airway package contains a SummarizedExperiment data class. This data describes an RNA-Seq experiment on four human airway smooth muscle cell lines treated with dexamethasone. {Note: for some of the packages, you will have to install packaged from the CRAN repository, using the install.packages() function. The examples will show you which install method to use.} &lt;img src=&quot;07-activity_introduction_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_56.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted.&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt; Load the example data. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot is frequently used to explore differences in samples. When this data is MDS transformed, the first two dimensions explain the greatest variance between samples, and the amount of variance decreases monotonically with increasing dimension. The following code will launch a new window where you can interact with the MDS plot. Change the colour_by setting to “groups” so you can easily distinguish between groups. In this data, the “group” is the treatment. You can download the interactive html file by clicking on “Save As”. You can also download plots and other files created directly in RStudio. To download the following plot, click on “Export” and save in your preferred format to the default directory. This saves the file in your cloud environment. You should see the plot in the “Files” pane. Select this file and click “More” &gt; “Export” Select “Download” to save the file to your local machine. 12.3.6 Pausing RStudio You can view costs and make changes to your cloud environments from the panel on the far right of the page. If you don’t see this panel, you may need to scroll to the right. Running environments will have a green dot, and paused environments will have an orange dot. Hovering over the RStudio icon will show you the costs associated with your RStudio environment. Click on the RStudio icon to open the cloud environment settings. Click the Pause button to pause RStudio. This will take a few minutes. When the environment is paused, an orange dot will be displayed next to the RStudio icon. If you hover over the icon, you will see that it is paused, and has a small ongoing cost as long as it is paused. When you’re ready to resume working, you can do so by clicking the RStudio icon and clicking Resume. The right-hand side icon reminds you that you are accruing cloud computing costs. If you don’t see this icon, you may need to scroll to the right. You should minimize charges when you are not performing an analysis. You can do this by clicking on the RStudio icon and selecting “Pause”. This will release the CPU and memory resources for other people to use. Note that your work will be saved in the environment and continue to accrue a very small cost. This work will be lost if the cloud environment gets deleted. If there is anything you would like to save permanently, it’s a good idea to copy it from your compute environment to another location, such as the Workspace bucket, GitHub, or your local machine, depending on your needs. You can also pause your cloud environment(s) at https://anvil.terra.bio/#clusters. 12.3.7 Deleting RStudio Pausing your cloud environment only temporarily stops your work. When you are ready to delete the cloud environment, click on the RStudio icon on the right-hand side and select “Settings”. If you don’t see this icon, you may need to scroll to the right. Click on “Delete Environment”. If you are certain that you do not need the data and configuration on your disk, you should select “Delete everything, including persistent disk”.
