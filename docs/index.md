## Learning Objectives {-}

This activity addresses the following Core Concepts and Competencies as stated in the [Genetics Core Competencies](https://genetics-gsa.org/education/genetics-learning-framework/):

1. Core Competency: Critique large data sets and use bioinformatics to assess genetics data.
1. Core Competency: Generate and interpret graphs displaying experimental results.
1. Evolution and Population Genetics: Explain how natural selection and genetic drift can affect the elimination, maintenance or increase in frequency of various types of alleles (e.g. dominant, recessive, deleterious, beneficial) in a population.


This activity also addresses the following core competency from the Bioinformatics core competencies for undergraduate life sciences education from [NIBLSE] (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196878.t002):

1. Use bioinformatics tools to examine complex biological problems in evolution, information flow, and other important areas of biology.
1. Use command-line bioinformatics tools and write simple computer scripts.
